# exam-tracker

### This is a simple exam tracker app that I made to help me keep track of my exams and their dates. It is

### written using Next.js and TailwindCSS. It does not use any database, so all the data is stored in the

### browser's local storage.

##### All Data is web scraped from the by selecting the latest semster [KFUPM Registrar Exam Schedule Website](https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/examinations/exam-schedule) using [Puppeteer]

#### The data is sorted by date and time and displayed in a table.

#### The user can add exams to the list by clicking on the add button to pin add course in your local storage.

#### The user can also delete exams from the list by clicking on the delete button.

#### The user can download a file containing the list of exams by clicking on the download button (txt, csv, xlsx).
